b)Find `app.jso`. 🧐

c)Tap on that. 😬

d)Tap to edit and just add `n` at last of name (Don't touch code🤦). ✍️

e)It should look like `app.json`. 🎉

f)Then tap 👇👇

 Heroku is not supported now 😕 #Dead

Better buy a vps 😐 and follow [this](https://github.com/gautamajay52/TorrentLeech-Gdrive#process-to-run-this-bot-on-vps)

## Process to run this BOT on VPS

- Clone this repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/kaviya-admin/TorrentLeech-Gdrive
cd torrentleech-gdrive
```

- Install requirements
For Debian based distros
```
sudo apt install python3

sudo snap install docker
```
SET UP THE DOCKER REPOSITORY
sudo apt-get update
Then,

sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
Then,

curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
Then,

sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu focal stable"
Then,

sudo apt-get update
Then,

apt-cache policy docker-ce
Then,

sudo apt-get install -y docker-ce
Then,

sudo systemctl status docker
Then,

sudo apt-get update
Then,

sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
Then (optional step to test run your docker installation),

sudo docker run hello-world
Then,

sudo apt-get install python3-pip && pip3 install --upgrade pip
Then,

pip3 install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
Then,

cp tobrot/g_config.py tobrot/config.py
Use the details gotten from below to fill your config.py file.

N.B. I used the default MobaXterm text editor when editing my config.py file. You can choose to use the default nano editor on Linux, e.g by running nano config.py command.

Botfather Bot Token

Telegram App ID and API hash

Auth Channel ID is gotten using What’s my ID

The destination folder is gotten using the folder ID in your Google Drive or Team Drive, where you want your downloads to go into.

RClone Config is gotten by setting up a remote for your Team Drive or Google Drive you want to use as your download destination directory. Check out my other guide on how to create a Rclone config. If you are using a TD as your download destination, also make sure you include the Team Drive ID in the Rclone config.

N.B. Ensure you don’t remove the tripple quotation marks and also ensure you separate each line entry by a \n.

Troubleshooting Docker Issues
If Docker fails to start due to “volume store metadata database: timeout”
Run the below code:
ps axf | grep docker | grep -v grep | awk '{print "kill -9 " $1}' | sudo sh
Then,

sudo systemctl start docker
Then skip running sudo dockerd as given under deploying bot above.

To Install pip3 run the below command:
sudo apt-get install python3-pip && pip3 install --upgrade pip
Common Errors and Troubleshooting Solutions
Error #1:

Docker fails to start due to "volume store metadata database: timeout"
Solution #1: run the following codes serially:

ps axf | grep docker | grep -v grep | awk '{print "kill -9 " $1}' | sudo sh
Then,

sudo systemctl start docker
Thereafter skip running the sudo dockerd cmd. Instead continue your bot deployment with the next cmd.

Error #2:

failed to start daemon: pid file found, ensure docker is not running or delete the /var/run/docker.pid
Solution #2: You need to delete the docker.pid file in the /var/run directory. Run these codes below to get this done.

cd ~
Then,

cd /var/run
Then,

sudo rm -r docker.pid
Then navigate back to your bot directory and continue your bot deployment process.

To Stop a Docker Container
Run this code:

sudo docker ps
Copy the Docker container ID after running the above code and use in the below code (without the quotation marks):

sudo docker stop "container ID copied from step above"
Then you can restart another Docker container starting from the code below code and continue as explained above:

sudo docker build . -t torrentleech-gdrive
Then,

sudo docker run torrentleech-gdrive
